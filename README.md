# movie-app made with love as a challenging myself. I just wanted to try, if I could build an applicaton like that from scratch. 

## I did. 

### You can take a look at alive version here, if Heroku still serves it ;) https://vue-moviefy-app-made-wth-love.herokuapp.com/#/movies

## Of course, you can run it locally. Just do 

`git clone https://github.com/maximakymenko/Moviefy-Vue.git`
`cd Moviefy-Vue`
`npm install`
`npm run serve`
To run E2E tests do the following: 
`./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`

Hope you will like it.
